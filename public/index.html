          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>The social determinants of health in poverty describe the factors that affect impoverished populations' health and health inequality. Inequalities in health stem from the conditions of people's lives, including living conditions, work environment, age, and other social factors, and how these affect people's ability to respond to illness.[1] These conditions are also shaped by political, social, and economic structures.[1] The majority of people around the globe do not meet their potential best health because of a "toxic combination of bad policies, economics, and politics".[1] Daily living conditions work together with these structural drivers to result in the social determinants of health.[1]

            Poverty and poor health are inseparably linked.[1] Poverty has many dimensions – material deprivation (of food, shelter, sanitation, and safe drinking water), social exclusion, lack of education, unemployment, and low income – that all work together to reduce opportunities, limit choices, undermine hope, and, as a result, threaten health.[2] Poverty has been linked to higher prevalence of many health conditions, including increased risk of chronic disease, injury, deprived infant development, stress, anxiety, depression, and premature death.[2] According to Loppie and Wien, these health afflictions of poverty most burden outlying groups such as women, children, ethnic minorities, and the disabled.[2] Social determinants of health – like child development, education, living and working conditions, and healthcare[1]- are of special importance to the impoverished.</p>
